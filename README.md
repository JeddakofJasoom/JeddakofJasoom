Hello! I just started using GitHub, here's my initial draft for my profile page:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: creating automated workstation deployment for Windows 11 (24H2) for my company. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: how to use Windows SCM to create a "golden image," autounattend.xml file, and powershell script to automate system settings configuration, user profile configuration, application install, OS and OEM software updates for new Windows workstations. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: bloatware removal scripts in Windows 11 for general users to use. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: fixing answer file in 24H2 to actually work. Microsoft apparently broke the standard answer file format in 24H2 (along with a few dozen other issues with this cumulative update). 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything IT related, martial arts, and good SF/F books to read. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: private message me for my linkedin & email. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have 20+ years of martial arts training including black belts in 5 disciplines - karate, combat hapkido, kickboxing, taekwondo, and modern arnis.
